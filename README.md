## About The Project

This project is something I worked on during University. It's a collection of all the Data Structures and Algorithms we learnt about during the unit. I have structured the project where I could add new things and also test them using Dotnet's xUnit test.


### Built With

-   [Dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)
-   [xUnit](https://xunit.net)
